const ALIAS_RULES = [
  "CHAIN SYNTAX: 'def' is a space-separated chain of alias calls, and a backslash separates an alias name from its args (and arg from arg), e.g. 'slot\\2 wait\\1 +forward swapSlot\\2\\c3'.",
  'QUOTING: spaces split the chain, so a multi-word argument must be wrapped in double quotes with the opening quote right after the backslash arg-divider: say\\"hello world" or sendCommand\\"time set day".',
  "NESTING: in alias's args, ';' converts to a real space — write ';' instead of spaces to keep a nested chain intact, e.g. 'alias\\newAlias;+forward;wait\\20;-forward'. Elsewhere ';' is literal.",
  "SILENT FAILURES: misspelled names and bad args are skipped silently (runAlias still returns ok) — verify with getState, getScreenshot, or the state/channels returned in the response envelope.",
  "DETERMINISM: the host injects no physical input — state changes come only from your chains or game logic, so held keys behave exactly as vanilla and screens change only from your chains or game events (e.g. death).",
  'TIMING: wait\\N defers the rest of the chain by N ticks; runAlias returns immediately without waiting chain of alias done. At default speed keep time-sensitive steps in ONE runAlias call (inter-call latency is unpredictable); at a low tick rate (sendCommand\\"tick rate 1") an observe->reason->react cycle costs low ticks, so steps spread across calls — and keys held between calls — could stay predictable.',
  "RELEASE RULE: +x persists until -x, across tool calls and screen transitions. Held states re-fire their press action whenever a screen closes and the cursor re-grabs. Release when the effect should stop; one-shot keys right after press: '+advancements wait\\1 -advancements'. Watch the held_keys state field to see what is currently held.",
  "SCREENS: while any GUI screen is open, +attack/+use presses are suppressed (releases still work). While a text-input screen is open (chat, sign, book, command block), all key-like presses are suppressed. Movement aliases (+forward, +jump, +sneak, etc.) still work under non-text screens like inventory and containers.",
  "VARIABLES: numbers stored via the var alias can be used as numeric args anywhere (slot, wait, yaw, pitch, setYaw, setPitch, swapSlot), e.g. 'var\\s\\hotbarSlot slot\\1 ... slot\\s'. Variables set from a c<N> source (var\\name\\c3) are stored in a special map only accessible by swapSlot and treated as container-slot references by swapSlot.",

  "+drop / -drop — press drops one item of the held stack; hold to keep dropping. In a container screen drops from the hovered slot.

Stack split: drop part of a stack, then swapSlot the remainder into a container slot so the piles won't re-merge",
