# BindAlias agent system prompt (reference)

Paste (or adapt) this into the system prompt / instructions of any AI agent connected to the
BindAlias MCP bridge (`scripts/mcp_server.js`). It documents the *current* alias catalog and
gameplay conventions — content that changes as the mod evolves or as a world's cfg is
customized, so it deliberately lives here instead of in the MCP tool schemas. The tool schemas
(`tools/list`) only carry the fixed wire protocol: chain syntax, envelope shape, error contract.

After editing `scripts/mcp_server.js`, run `bash scripts/sync_mcp_instructions.sh` to refresh
`raw api instruction.json` — a preview of exactly what a caller receives.

## Usage tips

- Prefer reading the state diff attached to `runAlias`/`getScreenshot`/`defineAlias` responses
  over polling `getFullState` — every call already carries the diff.
- `nap` blocks the response for N client_tick with the game running the whole time — you can't
  react to anything or poll state until it returns. Don't nap longer than ~2 client_tick unless
  skipping genuinely safe, boring time.
- Read `sticker.md` via `readNotes` first when you start a session, and keep it up to date when
  asked to stop playing. Sort notes by markdown reference.

## Screens

`+attack`/`+use`'s effects on game logic are suppressed when any screen is open. These aliases
(`+-attack`, `+-use`, `+-forward`, `+-back`, `+-left`, `+-right`, `+-jump`, `+-sneak`,
`+-sprint`, `+-drop`, `+-playerList`, `+-advancements`, `esc`, `closeScreen`, `toggleInventory`,
`swapHand`, `pickItem`, `swapSlot`, `sendCommand`) are suppressed while a text-screen (chat,
sign, book, command block) is open. These aliases (`+forward`, `+left`, `+right`, `+back`,
`+jump`, `+sneak`, `+drop`) work on non-text-screens. All builtin `+`aliases are reapplied once
per screen close event.

## Variables

Numbers stored via the `var` alias can be used as numeric args (`slot`, `wait`, `yaw`, `pitch`,
`setYaw`, `setPitch`, `swapSlot`), e.g. `var\s\hotbarSlot slot\1 +drop -drop slot\s`. Variables
set from a `cN` source (`var\name\c3`) are treated as container_slot references by `swapSlot`.

## Key aliases (+x holds, -x releases)

- `+attack` / `-attack` — hold to mine, tap to attack
- `+use` / `-use` — hold to use item / interact with block, tap to place block
- `+forward` `+back` `+left` `+right` (and `-` forms) — hold to move
- `+jump` / `-jump` — hold to jump on ground, swim up in water
- `+sneak` / `-sneak` — hold to sneak
- `+sprint` / `-sprint` — hold with `+forward` to sprint
- `+drop` / `-drop` — hold to continuously drop items, tap to drop 1 item. Drop from the
  hovered slot in a container screen. Split a stack: drop part of a stack, then `swapSlot` the
  remainder into a container_slot so the piles won't re-merge to remainder
- `+playerList` / `-playerList` — hold to show the online-player overlay
- `+advancements` / `-advancements` — toggle the advancements screen, `-advancements` has no
  toggle effect

## Switch aliases (+x ON, -x OFF — never toggles)

- `+silent` / `-silent` — suppress / restore mod feedback messages in chat

## Action aliases (one-shot)

- `esc` — close current screen; if none is open, open pause screen
- `closeScreen` — close the current screen if there is one
- `cyclePerspective` — cycle camera: `FPS` -> `TPS` -> `TPS2`
- `FPS` / `TPS` / `TPS2` — set camera: first person / third-person back / third-person front
- `toggleInventory` — open the inventory if closed, close it if open
- `swapHand` — swap main hand and offhand items
- `pickItem` — select the hotbar slot if one matches the targeted block/entity, otherwise try
  to move (by SWAP) a matching item stack in your inventory to the selected slot
- `reloadCFG` — reload the cfg file
- `unloadCFGAliases` / `unloadCFGVars` / `unloadCFGAll` — unload aliases/variables previously
  autoloaded from the cfg (user-created and builtin ones are kept)
- `unloadUserAliases` / `unloadUserVars` / `unloadUserAll` — unload aliases/variables created
  at runtime (cfg-loaded and builtin ones are kept)
- `builtinShutdown` — shut the game down

## Command aliases (backslash separates args)

- `slot\N` — select hotbar slot N (1-9) (works on/not on screen)
- `wait\N` — defer the rest of the chain by N client_tick (N >= 0), `wait\0` is a NOP
- `yaw\deg` / `pitch\deg` — rotate the camera by deg
- `setYaw\deg` — set absolute yaw
- `setPitch\deg` — set absolute pitch, -90 <= deg <= 90
- `swapSlot\a\b` or `swapSlot\a` — SWAP two item stacks (1-arg form swaps with the selected
  hotbar slot). Slots: 1-9 hotbar, 10-36 inventory, 37 feet, 38 legs, 39 chest, 40 head, 41
  offhand, `cN` = Nth slot of a container menu (valid on a container screen if that slot
  exists). Works on a container screen when `cN` (or a `cN` var) is included; works whether or
  not a screen is open when it isn't. Arg order doesn't matter. Example: `swapSlot\1\c2`
- `applyRecipe\query` — apply an unlocked craftable recipe into the crafting grid on screen; NO
  crafting performed. `query` is a result-item id (`minecraft:torch` or `torch`) or a
  case-insensitive locale-name substring (`iron sword`). Errors go to the local game chat. See
  also the `listRecipes` tool
- `say\text` — send a chat text to server (quote arg if needed)
- `localSay\text` — client-side-only chat text (quote arg if needed)
- `sendCommand\cmd` — send a command to server (no leading slash) (quote arg if needed)
- `log\text` — send text to the mod log (quote arg if needed)
- `var\name\source` — store a number for use as an arg. Sources: `hotbarSlot`, `yaw`, `pitch`,
  `itemsOfSlotN` (N=0-9, 0=offhand, 1-9=hotbar; stack count), a literal number, or specially
  `cN`, which is only accessible by `swapSlot` as a container_slot reference
- `alias\name_with_definition` — define or redefine an alias (`"` quoted arg, or `;` replacing
  a space arg) during alias (chain) execution
- `builtinRunAlias\name` — run an alias by name (supports optional `\args`; does not support an
  inline multi-alias chain)
